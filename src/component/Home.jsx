                    We are currently living in uncertain times with the outbreak of COVID-19. During times like this, our faith can be challenged, and it can be hard to see where God fits in with this new normal.

                    We have pulled together some of our favorite prayers, poems, inspirational quotes and reflections to provide hope to you and your loved ones during this time. While reading these messages of hope, take some time to quietly reflect on the words as well as the emotions they bring out in you.

                    “2020”
                    This year has been marked with reflection and change;
                    some days feel good and others feel strange.
                    We’ve learned to work differently;
                    and love more unconditionally.
                    We try to tune out the stress;
                    but sometimes life still feels like a mess.
                    We find ways to turn negatives into good;
                    and learn new skills that we thought we never could.
                    We find ways to travel to less congested places;
                    and we meet our friends with covered faces.
                    Hopefully this year has been filled with opportunity;
                    and we’ve tried to exercise and strengthen our immunity.
                    2020 hasn’t been like we expected;
                    but we’ve found new ways to stay connected.
                    Hug your kids and enjoy the outdoors;
                    worry less about the very small chores.
                    Things will get better because they usually do;
                    enjoy what you love and learn something new.
                    Don’t forget to pray and always be kind;
                    try to stay positive and learn to unwind.
                    The story has been written, good wins in the end;
                    prayers for all my family and friends.

                    “Behind the mask”
                    Behind the mask is a patient in fear, unsure what will happen after being brought here.
                    Behind the mask is someone special who, was born for this moment to take care of you.
                    Behind the mask is someone’s son or daughter, guiding you through these unchartered waters.
                    Behind the mask, someone comes to you in prayer, full of mission and faith, guiding your care.
                    Behind the mask, someone is leading the way, planning and supporting the staff through the day.
                    Behind the mask someone silently prepares, clean rooms, or meals, even meds for your care.
                    Behind the mask someone can come where you live, bringing care, meds or equipment, more passion to give.
                    Behind the mask, there is one ministry for all, no role is too big, no position too small.
                    Behind the mask, is our promise to you, we answered the call, it’s what we were all meant to do.

                        Sun is not cancelled
                        Spring is not cancelled

                        Bible Verse and Reflection #1
                        “He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.” (Revelation 21:4)

                        Is anything more amazing and awe-inspiring than the idea that our God who created the stars and planets, mountains and oceans, cares so much for us in our distress that he has promised to wipe away every tear.

                        (Alex Garvey, PhD)

                        Bible Verse and Reflection #2
                        “Have no anxiety at all; but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, make your requests known to God.” (Philippians 4:6)

                        Loving God, we arise today to face the challenges on the road ahead.  It is clear that our current situation needs us to be steadfast and persistent in our response to COVID-19; as this is a marathon, not a sprint.  Be with us now O Lord!

                        Loving father during your Ministry on earth Your sign was the healing you shared with us, and Your promise to take away our anxieties the symbol of your eternal presence.

                        Be present to Your people who suffer and allow them to feel your healing touch through the compassionate care of our Doctors, nurses and caregivers.  Remove any fear, feelings of anxiousness, or uncertainties from our hearts.  Let us trust in You.  Protect our friends, families and coworkers and bring Your peace to all who support us.

                        Give us your Grace O Lord so we can speak calmly, clearly and truthfully with each other.  Let us see one another as You see us.  May truth, empathy and kindness remain our steadfast rock!  Give spouses a patient and compassion place for each other.  Be with worn-out parents and give them Your love so that they may speak words of kindness and encouragement to their children.  Be with us now, O Lord!

                        Let us sanitize more and pray more.  Let us be kinder than we have to in adversity.  Let us speak warmer that we need to in duress.  Let us act more compassionately than we should do with others…and let us start and end each day on our knees, enraptured with a loving God, who by prayer and petition, in thanksgiving, we make every request known, too!  Be with us now O Lord!

                Yes there is panic buying.
                Yes there is sickness.
                Yes there is even death.
                But,
                They say that in Wuhan after so many years of noise
                You can hear the birds again.
                They say that after just a few weeks of quiet
                The sky is no longer thick with fumes
                But blue and grey and clear.
                They say that in the streets of Assisi
                People are singing to each other
                across the empty squares,
                keeping their windows open
                so that those who are alone
                may hear the sounds of family around them.
                They say that a hotel in the West of Ireland
                is offering free meals and delivery to the housebound.
                Today a young woman I know
                is busy spreading fliers with her number
                through the neighborhood
                so that the elders may have someone to call on.
                Today Churches, Synagogues, Mosques and Temples
                are preparing to welcome
                and shelter the homeless, the sick, the weary.
                All over the world people are slowing down and reflecting.
                All over the world people are looking at their neighbors in a new way.
                All over the world people are waking up to a new reality
                To how big we really are.
                To how little control we really have.
                To what really matters.
                To Love.
                So we pray and we remember that
                Yes there is fear.
                But there does not have to be hate.
                Yes there is isolation.
                But there does not have to be loneliness.
                Yes there is panic buying.
                But there does not have to be meanness.
                Yes there is sickness.
                But there does not have to be disease of the soul.
                Yes there is even death.
                But there can always be a rebirth of love.
                Wake to the choices you make as to how to live now.
                Today, breathe.
                Listen, behind the factory noises of your panic-
                The birds are singing again
                The sky is clearing,
                Spring is coming,
                And we are always encompassed by Love.
                Open the windows of your soul
                And though you may not be able
                to touch across the empty square,
                Sing.

                (Fr. Richard Hendrick, OFM, March 13, 2020)

                Prayer During a Pandemic
                Loving God, Holy One,
                Your desire is for our wholeness and well-being.
                We hold in tenderness and prayer
                the collective suffering of
                our world at this time.
                We grieve precious lives lost and
                vulnerable lives threatened.
                We ache for ourselves and
                our neighbors, standing
                before an uncertain future.
                We pray: may love, not fear, go viral.
                Inspire our leaders to discern and
                choose wisely, aligned with the
                common good.
                Help us to practice social distancing
                and reveal to us new and creative
                ways to come together in spirit
                and in solidarity.
                Call us to profound trust in Your
                Faithful presence,
                You, the God who does not abandon,
                You, the Holy One,
                breathing within us,
                breathing among us,
                breathing around us
                in our beautiful yet
                wounded world.
